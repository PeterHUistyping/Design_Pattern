# Design Pattern

## What is a Design Pattern?
● Standard solution to recurring problem \
● Codification of best practices \
● Has a name, problem, environment, solution, variations, sample code \
● Originally 23 patterns, now many more. Useful to look at because they \
illustrate some of the power of OOP (and also some of the pitfalls)

## How do Design Patterns help developers?
● Pattern gives name/vocabulary for communication of intent \
    ○ No need to explain details in e.g., code reviews \
● Provides as a “template” a worked-out “best practices” solution for you  \
    ○ Has been reviewed by many senior developers \
● With practice you will recognize the patterns in existing code \
● And hopefully remember to use them in new code 👍
